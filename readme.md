## Code Structure

### 1. **HTML (`index.html`)**:

- Contains the structure of the calculator, including the input field and buttons.

### 2. **CSS (`style.css`)**:

- Styles the calculator with a dark theme and ensures responsiveness.
- Uses `flexbox` for layout and `media queries` for responsiveness.

### 3. **JavaScript (`script.js`)**:

- Handles the logic for button clicks, calculations, and input updates.
- Uses `eval()` to compute mathematical expressions (with error handling).

## Responsive Design

The calculator is designed to be fully responsive:

- **Desktop**: Fixed width with large buttons.
- **Tablet**: Slightly smaller buttons for medium screens.
- **Mobile**: Compact layout with smaller buttons for small screens.

## Customization

You can customize the calculator by:

1. Changing the background image in the `body` CSS rule.
2. Modifying the color scheme in the `style.css` file.
3. Adding new features (e.g., square root, exponentiation) in the `script.js` file.

## Example Calculations

- **Addition**: `2 + 3 = 5`
- **Subtraction**: `10 - 4 = 6`
- **Multiplication**: `5 * 6 = 30`
- **Division**: `20 / 4 = 5`
- **Percentage**: `50 % = 0.5`
